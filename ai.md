READING
I've been reading books ever since the wee age of 8. Only recently did I switch from fiction to business and history titles, something I never thought I'd do. The primary motivator was the dearth of insightful and comprehensive content available online on these topics.

I'm currently reading / finished the following set:
- The Gospel According to Disney: Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust
- Confessions of an Advertising Man
- Magician of the Movies: The Life of Walt Disney
- Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies
- An Illustrated History of Los Angeles County, California

WRITING
I've written a few articles on my not-so-periodic newsletter. I try to write about topics which really helped me or really capture my intrigue.
- [Why recruiters don't find your LinkedIn profile](https://newsletter.rittmang.xyz/p/why-recruiters-dont-find-your-linkedin)
- [Why Threads by Meta is hot](https://newsletter.rittmang.xyz/p/why-threads-by-meta-is-hot)
- [Why the Apple Vision Pro is insane](https://newsletter.rittmang.xyz/p/why-the-apple-vision-pro-is-insane)
- [Gmail’s spam filters hurt indie email](https://newsletter.rittmang.xyz/p/gmails-spam-filters-hurt-independent)

I also wrote a few short stories in the past, which I republished [here](/stories/)
